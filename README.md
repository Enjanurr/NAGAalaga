# 🌸 NAGAalaga: AI-Powered Maternal Health Companion

**Naga City Health Innovation Challenge 2026** — *Maternal & Child Health Track* **Team:** [Your Team Name]

NAGAalaga is a mobile-first platform engineered to solve the "Information Gap" in maternal healthcare within Naga City. We replace traditional, easily-lost paper "Pink Cards" with a verified, secure, and hyper-localized digital health assistant that speaks the mother's language.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🛡️ **Bicol-AI Triage**: An intelligent chat assistant powered by **Google Gemini** that understands Bicol-Naga and Tagalog to assess pregnancy symptoms.
* 📍 **Barangay-Centric Dashboard**: Real-time tracking of prenatal checkups and vaccination schedules specific to Naga City Health Centers.
* 🚫 **Risk Detection**: Automated flagging of "Red Flag" symptoms (e.g., preeclampsia signs) with immediate guidance for the mother.
* 💰 **BHW Connectivity**: A direct digital bridge between mothers and their assigned Barangay Health Workers for faster intervention.
